# Career Development Application (TeChar)

As students experiencing difficulty charting our future career paths, we encounter challenges acquiring adequate information for our career development. A lack of understanding of our interests and talents stands as a significant obstacle. Hence, we have chosen to address this issue as the foundation for developing the "Bridging Career Development and Preparation in Technology" application, aimed to support students majoring in computer science or related fields interested in careers within the technology industry. We prioritize incorporating five SDGs themes into our system to ensure its relevance and substantial impact for future users. Our application emphasizes the fusion of technology and career development, focusing on professional growth within the IT sector. We aim to provide specific attention to the quality and direction of sustainable development. With the primary goal of expediting career acceleration within the IT industry, our application is designed to simplify and hasten the career development process in the information technology sector. We are committed to being a platform that aids individuals in achieving the pinnacle of their careers in IT. Additionally, we are dedicated to providing information on evenly distributed training and scholarship opportunities for those interested in the technology field. This is envisioned to level the playing field in terms of access to information and training, thereby enhancing the quality of human resources within the IT sector and ultimately contributing to overall economic growth. The innovations we offer are tailored to benefit individuals with a background in computer science while striving to bridge the gaps in educational quality. Through collaborations with educational platforms such as Dicoding and Google for Developers, we aim to facilitate easier access for aspiring developers through the provided training. Our application includes a consultation feature, offering access to professional mentors and coaches to assist users in advancing their careers. The user-friendly Android-based application aims to increase accessibility, ensuring that a broader audience can easily utilize its features, expanding its reach and positive impact. We use Android Studio, Firebase, and TensorFlow technologies to develop this application.
